In this case study, we assume the role of data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, we want to understand **"How casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently?"**. From these insights, we will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
